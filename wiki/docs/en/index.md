## Meetings

### Scrum

We conduct weekly scrum meetings to discuss our ongoing projects,
address challenges, review the backlog, and assign available tasks to
team members.  These sessions are typically followed by a coding
session in our shared classroom (D-2020).

### Workshop

Every Friday afternoon, we hold a second meeting focused on
collaboration for ongoing projects. Team members are available to
assist with any issues related to their assigned tasks, and
collaboration is strongly encouraged.

### Schedule for the Fall 2025 Session

Weekly Meeting: **Tuesdays, 5:30 PM - 6:00 PM** (usually in room
D-3014 but check the discord for confirmation) Workshop: **Fridays,
starting at 12:00 PM** until evening in D-2020
