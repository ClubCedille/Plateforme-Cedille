## When Do Our Meetings Take Place

All our meetings are voluntary; we do not require a minimum level of involvement. However, the more you get involved, the more you will learn and the more fun you will have.

We usually have weekly meetings lasting 30 minutes where we discuss the progress of our projects. After that, we go to our club room, D-2020, to work together.

We also have another working session, which we call a ‘workshop,’ and it is longer.

### Schedule for the Fall 2025 Session

Weekly Meeting: **Wednesdays, 5:30 PM - 6:00 PM** (usually in room A-1300 or D-2040)
Workshop: **Fridays, starting at 12:00 PM** until evening

## Background

This wiki is the primary resource for our members and partners. It contains
information about our projects, services, and best practices. Whether you are a
developer, a system administrator, or an end-user, we have information to help
you get familiar with the CEDILLE platform and make the most of it.

Here, you will find detailed guides, tutorials, best practices information, and
answers to your most frequently asked questions. We have worked hard to make
this documentation as clear and accessible as possible, but since everything is
new, we are eager to receive your feedback to further improve it!

The CEDILLE platform was designed to meet our clients' needs for hosting
services on bare-metal servers. It is based on Kubernetes, an open-source
containerization technology that offers exceptional flexibility and scalability
for deploying and managing services.

Our goal is to provide a simple, reliable, and high-performance hosting platform
for our clients while offering our team members an educational and enriching
development and deployment experience.
