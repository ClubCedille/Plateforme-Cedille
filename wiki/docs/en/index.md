## Meetings
### Scrum
We have scrum-style weekly meetings where we discuss current projects, 
hurdles, go over the backlog and distribute available tasks to
members. It is usually followed by a coding session back at our 
shared classroom (D-2020).

### Workshop
A second meeting takes place every friday afternoon, where we 
collaborate on ongoing projects. Members are available to help 
on issues with assigned tasks and collaboration is encouraged.

### Schedule for the Fall 2025 Session

Weekly Meeting: **Wednesdays, 5:30 PM - 6:00 PM** (usually in room
A-1300 or D-2040) Workshop: **Fridays, starting at 12:00 PM** until
evening
