# Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions

Continuous Deployment (CD) involves automating the deployment of new versions of an application directly into production environments after passing testing and validation stages. GitHub Actions allows setting up CD pipelines for cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

---

## 1. Deploying an Application on Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)

GitHub Actions can be used to automate application deployment on popular cloud services such as **AWS**, **Microsoft Azure**, and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. Each cloud provider has its own tools and services for managing application deployment.

### 1.1 Deployment on AWS

AWS offers several services for hosting applications, including **Elastic Beanstalk**, **ECS (Elastic Container Service)**, and **S3**. With GitHub Actions, you can configure workflows to automatically deploy your applications to these services.

#### Example Workflow for Deploying on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Elastic Beanstalk simplifies deployment and management of applications on AWS. Here is an example workflow for deploying a Node.js application to Elastic Beanstalk.

```yaml
name: Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Configure AWS credentials
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1

      # Step 3: Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk
      - name: Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk
        run: |
          zip -r app.zip .  # Zip the application
          aws elasticbeanstalk create-application-version --application-name MyApp --version-label latest --source-bundle S3Bucket=my-app-bucket,S3Key=app.zip
          aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name MyApp-env --version-label latest
```

### 1.2 Deployment on Microsoft Azure

Azure offers several services for hosting applications, such as **Azure App Service** and **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. With GitHub Actions, you can automate deployment to these services using Azure-specific actions.

#### Example Workflow for Deploying to Azure App Service

Azure App Service is a platform that allows deploying web applications on a managed environment. Here is an example workflow for deploying a web application to Azure App Service.

```yaml
name: Deploy to Azure App Service

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Configure Azure credentials
      - name: Log in to Azure
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      # Step 3: Deploy to Azure App Service
      - name: Deploy to Azure App Service
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: "my-app-service"
          package: .
```

### 1.3 Deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Google Cloud Platform offers services like **Google App Engine**, **Google Cloud Run**, and **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**. GitHub Actions can be used to automate deployments on GCP.

#### Example Workflow for Deploying to Google Cloud Run

Google Cloud Run enables deploying containerized applications directly from a GitHub repository. Here is an example workflow for deploying an application to Google Cloud Run.

```yaml
name: Deploy to Google Cloud Run

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Configure Google Cloud credentials
      - name: Authenticate to Google Cloud
        uses: google-github-actions/auth@v0
        with:
          credentials_json: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}

      # Step 3: Set up Google Cloud SDK
      - name: Set up Cloud SDK
        uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v1
        with:
          project_id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
          service_account_key: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}

      # Step 4: Build and deploy Docker image to Cloud Run
      - name: Build and Deploy to Cloud Run
        run: |
          gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}/my-app
          gcloud run deploy my-app --image gcr.io/${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}/my-app --region us-central1
```

## 2. Practical Examples of Continuous Deployment Pipelines

CI/CD pipelines consist of automated steps that handle the build, test, and deployment of an application. Here are some practical examples of continuous deployment pipelines with GitHub Actions.

### Basic Pipeline for a Node.js Application Deployed to AWS S3

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js and dependencies
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 3: Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      # Step 4: Build application
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

      # Step 5: Connect to AWS
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-west-1

      # Step 6: Deploy the application to an S3 bucket
      - name: Deploy to S3
        run: aws s3 sync ./build s3://my-app-bucket --delete
```

## 3. Deployment Strategies: Blue/Green, Canary

GitHub Actions can be used to implement various **deployment strategies**, such as **Blue/Green** and **Canary** deployment, to minimize risks during production deployments.

### 3.1 Blue/Green Deployment

**Blue/Green deployment** involves running two distinct environments: the **Blue** (old) environment and the **Green** (new) environment. Once deployment is ready on the Green environment, traffic is switched to this environment.

#### Example Workflow for Blue/Green Deployment

```yaml
name: Blue/Green Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 1: Deploy to Green environment
      - name: Deploy to Green environment
        run: |
          aws deploy create-deployment \
            --application-name my-app \
            --deployment-group-name GreenEnvironment \
            --s3-location bucket=my-app-bucket,bundleType=zip,key=my-app.zip

      # Step 2: Switch traffic to Green
      - name: Switch traffic to Green
        run: |
          aws deploy update-deployment-group \
            --application-name my-app \
            --current-deployment-group-name BlueEnvironment \
            --new-deployment-group-name GreenEnvironment
```

### 3.2 Canary Deployment

**Canary deployment** deploys a new version to a small percentage of users to test its impact. If the Canary version is stable, deployment is gradually extended to all users.

#### Example Workflow for Canary Deployment

```yaml
name: Canary Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 1: Deploy Canary release (small percentage of users)
      - name: Deploy Canary release
        run: |
          aws deploy create-deployment \
            --application-name my-app \
            --deployment-group-name CanaryEnvironment \
            --s3-location bucket=my-app-bucket,bundleType=zip,key=my-app.zip \
            --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime

      # Step 2: Gradually increase deployment
      - name: Gradually increase deployment
        run: |
          aws deploy create-deployment \
            --application-name my-app \
            --deployment-group-name ProductionEnvironment \
            --s3-location bucket=my-app-bucket,bundleType=zip,key=my-app.zip
```

## 4. Deployment Status Notifications (Slack, Email)

GitHub Actions enables sending notifications about the status of a successful or failed deployment via **Slack**, **Email**, or other collaboration tools.

### 4.1 Slack Notifications

You can configure GitHub Actions to send notifications via Slack when specific events

 occur, such as deployment completion.

#### Example Workflow with Slack Notification

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline with Slack Notifications

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to production
        run: ./deploy.sh

  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-and-deploy
    steps:
      - name: Send Slack Notification
        uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
        env:
          SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
          SLACK_MESSAGE: "The deployment to production was successful!"
```

### 4.2 Email Notifications

You can also configure email notifications using GitHub actions or third-party services to send emails after deployment.

#### Example Workflow with Email Notification

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline with Email Notifications

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to production
        run: ./deploy.sh

  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-and-deploy
    steps:
      - name: Send Email Notification
        uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v2
        with:
          server_address: smtp.gmail.com
          server_port: 465
          username: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}
          subject: "Deployment Status"
          body: "The deployment was successful."
          to: "recipient@example.com"
```
