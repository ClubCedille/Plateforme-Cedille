# Learning GitHub Actions

Welcome to the GitHub Actions documentation for beginners!

This guide is designed to help you get started with GitHub Actions, a powerful
tool that allows you to automate Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous
Deployment (CD), and much more directly from your GitHub repository. Whether
you're an experienced developer or simply curious about GitHub Actions, this
documentation will provide the foundational knowledge you need to start
automating your workflows and streamlining your DevOps processes.

- **Introduction to GitHub Actions** Learn key concepts such as workflows, jobs,
  steps, and runners, as well as the differences between GitHub Actions and
  other CI/CD tools.

- **Getting Started with GitHub Actions** Discover how to set up your first
  workflows, write YAML files, and use triggers to automate your tasks.

- **Creating Custom Workflows** Understand how to create more advanced workflows
  by defining jobs, using pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace, and
  creating your own custom actions.

- **Integration with Docker and Kubernetes** Learn how to automate Docker image
  builds, push them to registries, and deploy your applications to Kubernetes
  clusters.

- **Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions** Explore deployment strategies
  for your applications on cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, and
  learn how to configure deployment notifications.

- **Using GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** Discover how to use GitHub
  Container Registry to manage and distribute container images directly from
  GitHub.

- **Security and Permissions Management** Learn to use GitHub Secrets to manage
  sensitive information, configure workflow permissions, and integrate
  Dependabot for dependency security scanning.

- **CI/CD Workflow Optimization** Learn how to speed up your workflows by
  caching dependencies, managing dependency and action versions, and effectively
  debugging workflows.

- **Monitoring and Reporting** Discover how to monitor your workflows, generate
  automated test reports, and configure notifications for build success or
  failure.

- **Practical Examples: DevOps with GitHub Actions** Explore practical examples
  for deploying Node.js applications with Docker, managing CI/CD pipelines with
  cloud services, and automating complete DevOps chains.

- **Best Practices and DevOps Patterns with GitHub Actions** Discover strategies
  for structuring workflows in complex projects, centralizing configuration
  files, and managing multiple environments (development, staging, production).
