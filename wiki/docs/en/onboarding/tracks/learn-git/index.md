# Introduction to Source Control & Git

## What is Source Control?
Source control, or version control, is a system that helps **manage** and **track changes** in any digital project over time, which is code in our case.

It is especially useful for us since developping any software is a team effort, and a system is needed to allow everyone to **collaborate together** without overwriting everyone's changes.

Additionally, a source control system enables a **detailed history of changes**, allowing someone to easily **revert** to an earlier version without ever losing a single line of code.

You have probably used some form of Source Control in your life if you've collaborated with a team on any of Google's office suite (Ex. Docs,Sheets)! They allow collaboration on the same document, and provide a history of the changes made.

### Why do you need a source control system ?
- *Collaboration*: An entire team can work together on the same project, without stepping on anyone's foot
- *Backup*: Any line of code that has been pushed to the source control, will be there forever, no matter what
- *Track changes*: Easily find who added what to a project
- *Branching*: Allows the isolation of certain experimental features on a project, without impacting the main project.

## Git (A quick overview)
A source control system is just a bunch of ideas, which anyone can take and create their own functional integration. For us (*and most of the world*), we use [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/).
> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

It was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds (Creator of Linux) to help the collaborators of the Linux kernel (the heart of a operating system) work together. It has since stood the test of time, and is used by a vast majority of software developpement team.

It works very well for any project's sizes, while staying efficient. Furthermore, it is a *distributed system*, which means everyone working on a project has a local access to the entire history, without the need for a centralized server.

### Git's workflow

box Blue Local
    participant Working directory
    participant Staging
    participant Local Repo
end
box Orange Remote
    participant Remote Repo
end

Working directory->>Staging:git add
Staging->>Local Repo: git commit
Local Repo->>Remote Repo: git push
Remote Repo->>Local Repo: git pull
```

Git has 3 primary areas where all the action happens:

1. **Working directory**: This is the actual files you will be writing your code to !

2. **Staging area**: This a a buffer zone where your changes are stored before commiting them.

3. **Repository (local/remote)**: Also known as a *repo*, this is where all your changes are stored permanently. You have a local repository which can be different from the remote repository since Git is a *distributed* system.

Git has over a 150 different commands to interact with it ! In our case, we will focus on the following four, and we will see a couple more later on.

1. **`git add`**: Add or move a change from the working directory into the staging area.

2. **`git commit`**: Saves the changes you've added from the staging area into your local repo.

3. **`git push`**: When you are happy with all your changes in your local repo, it is time to push it into the remote repo and make it available to anyone working on the project !

4. **`git pull`**: As the name suggests, *pull* retrieves any changes on the remote repo into your local repo. If you've recently `git push` new changes into the remote repo, your colleagues will need to use `git pull` to have acces to them in their own local repo.

*we can ignore `git checkout` for now.*
