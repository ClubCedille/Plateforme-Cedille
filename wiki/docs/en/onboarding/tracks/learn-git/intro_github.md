# What is Github

As we've seen, our remote repository need to be hosted and available online. We've chosen [Github](https://github.com/) as our hosting platform for our Git repo because it adds a whole suite of tools, such as issue tracking, code reviews and automations.

Other popular Git platforms include:

- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/): Similar to Github, minus some cool tools.

- [Atlassian Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/): Deep integration with Atlassian Jira, a popular tool for team management & agile teams.

- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/devops): Microsoft's Git integration for their Azure environnement. Popular at the enterprise level.

## Why should you make an account on Github ?
Because of its popularity, Github has became a standard in the industry, and a great way to standout as a professionnal. Employers and recruiters will often look at your Github account, complimentary of a portfolio, to assess coding skills, collaboration ability and code quality.

> [Here's a great example](https://github.com/SonOfLope) of an account

If you do not already have a Github account, [create one right now](https://github.com/join) ! Try to keep it up to date with your developping skills. At the end of the onboarding, you will already have a couple projects to add to it !

You will see on your account a repository with your own username containing a file named `readme.md`, which is your profil page.
> Markdown (md) is a markup language that let's you easily format text. You can lookup a cheat sheet for all the available formatting. This wiki is written in markdown ! See [how to write it here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

In the following tutorial, we will edit it and make it better, as it is used like a LinkedIn page is used.
### Quick tips for your account:

- Repositories: Add any projects you are proud of ! (*If you are adding a school project, please talk to your teacher beforehand.*)

- Commit regularly and contribute to issues: This will show that you are an active user and you have an interest in programming.
