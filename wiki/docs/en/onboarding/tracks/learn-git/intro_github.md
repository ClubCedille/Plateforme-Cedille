# What is Github

As we've established, our remote repository must be hosted and accessible
online. We have selected [GitHub](https://github.com/) as our hosting platform
for the Git repository due to the visibility it provides, along with its
comprehensive suite of tools, including issue tracking, code reviews, and
automation features.

Other popular Git platforms include:

- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/): An open source Git platform with strong
  DevOps features. It can be self-hosted, offering more control over privacy and
  customization.

- [Atlassian Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/): Deep integration with
  Atlassian Jira, a popular tool for team management & agile teams.

- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/devops): Microsoft's
  Git integration for their Azure environnement. Popular at the enterprise
  level.

## Why should you make an account on Github ?

Because of its popularity, Github has became a standard in the industry, and a
great way to standout as a professionnal. Employers and recruiters will often
look at your Github account, complimentary of a portfolio, to assess coding
skills, collaboration ability and code quality.

> [Here's a great example](https://github.com/SonOfLope) of an account

If you do not already have a Github account, [create one right
now](https://github.com/join) ! Try to keep it up to date with your developping
skills. At the end of the onboarding, you will already have a couple projects to
add to it !

You will see on your account a repository with your own username containing a
file named `readme.md`, which is your profil page. > Markdown (md) is a markup
language that let's you easily format text. You can lookup a cheat sheet for all
the available formatting. This wiki is written in markdown ! See [how to write
it
here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

In the following tutorial, we will edit it and make it better, as it is used
like a LinkedIn page is used.

### Quick tips for your account

- Repositories: Add any projects you are proud of ! (_If you are adding a school
  project, please talk to your teacher beforehand._)

- Commit regularly and contribute to issues: This will show that you are an
  active user and you have an interest in programming.
