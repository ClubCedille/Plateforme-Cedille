# 🏛️ Lab: Enter the Hall of GitFame

## **Welcome, worthy one.**

This is **OlympGit**, the eternal resting place of the Git Immortals. If you
master the path of branching, merging, and resolving conflict, your name will be
carved at the top — forever.

Your task is to add your name to the Hall of GitFame — **at the top of the
list** — like all legends before you.

But beware: **Only the strong survive the merge**. And **only the wise** 🧙‍♂️ do
it through a **Pull Request**.

## 📦 Project Structure

This repo contains:

- `main` — neutral base branch (do not modify)
- `olympus` — the sacred branch where Immortals are written
- `HALL_OF_GITFAME.md` — the file where your name will live or die

---

## 🧭 Your Quest

### 1. Clone the Repository

Like the usual, start by cloning
[the repository](https://github.com/ClubCedille/OlympGit).

??? hint "Hint"

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:ClubCedille/OlympGit.git
cd OlympGit
```

---

### 2. Check Out the OlympGit Branch

Switch from the `main` branch to the `olympgit` branch.

??? hint "Hint"

``` bash
git checkout olympgit
git pull origin olympgit
```

---

### 3. Create Your Personal Branch from `OlympGit`

Create your branch under the name of add-your-name. Ex: add-linus-torvalds.

??? hint "Hint"

``` bash
git checkout -b add-<your-name>
```

---

### 4. Inscribe to the Hall

Edit `HALL_OF_GITFAME.md`, and insert your name at the top of the list:

!!! warning "Warning"

```text
    Add your name ON TOP of the Immortals list!
```

```diff
## 🧙 Immortals of Git

+- 🛡️ Your legendary name
 - 🧝‍♀️ Ada Lovelace
 - 🧙‍♂️ Linus Torvalds

```

!!! warning "Warning"

```text
Always add your name to the top of the list. Otherwise a challenger might come to try to steal your place!
```

---

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Now that you have added your name, let's commit the change to your branch.

??? hint "Hint"

``` bash
git add HALL_OF_GITFAME.md
git commit -m "feat: add Your Name to Hall of GitFame"
```

---

### 6. Push Your Branch to GitHub

Now that you've had your changes done locally, you have to put it on the remote
branch.

??? hint "Hint"

``` bash
git push origin add-your-name
```

---

### 7. Create a Pull Request (The Final Trial)

Now is the time to create a PR (pull request) on GitHub

??? hint "Hint"

- Head over to GitHub:

- You'll see a message: ➕ “Compare & Pull Request” → Click it.

- Set the base branch to olympgit

- The compare branch should be your add-your-name branch

- Add a message like:

```text
🏛️ Feat: Add [Your Name] to the Hall of GitFame

Adding my humble name to the top of the Immortals list.
Ready to resolve conflicts and claim my place.
```

- Submit the Pull Request

---

### 8. Resolve the Merge Conflict (⚔️ The Git Duel)

If your Pull Request cannot be merged automatically:

1. Click **Resolve conflicts** on GitHub.
2. You’ll see something like:

  ```text
  +<<<<<< HEAD
  - 🛡️ Hercules
  =======
  - 🛡️ Your Legendary Name
  +>>>>>> add-your-name
  ```

3. Manually _edit the conflict_ to keep all names & removing any Hydra Heads
   until none are left to slay:

  ```text
  - 🛡️ Your Legendary Name
  - 🛡️ Hercules
  ```

4. Click Mark as resolved

5. Commit the merge

---

### 9. Team Review & Approval (The Wisdom Council)

Before your PR can be merged into olympgit, your team captain, mentor, or peer
must:

- 👁️ Review your changes

- 💬 Leave comments if anything needs improvement

- ✅ Approve your Pull Request

> ❗ Do not merge your own PR unless explicitly allowed by your instructor or
> team lead.

If changes are requested:

- Make the required edits in your branch

- Push them again (git push origin add-your-name)

- Your PR will update automatically

---

### 10. Merge the Pull Request (Upon Approval)

Once your PR is:

- ✅ Approved by your reviewer(s)

- ✅ Free of conflicts

Then, and only then:

- Click Squash and Merge

- Confirm the final commit message (or customize it)

---
