# Onboarding

## Context and objectives

This integration process helps new members get familiar with our environment,
tools, and culture. It aims to make them quickly productive and give them an
overall understanding of our projects and their impact.

## CEDILLE philosophy

At CEDILLE, our mission is to create opportunities for members to grow by
actively contributing to meaningful projects. We aim to build a vibrant
community where students can collaborate, gain hands-on experience, and acquire
practical knowledge through tackling projects that matter. By partaking in these
projects, members naturally bridge the gap between academia and industry,
gaining the skills and confidence needed to thrive in both worlds.

We believe growth happens through action. By working on impactful projects,
members not only develop technical and problem-solving skills but also build
confidence and a sense of purpose. This process enables them to transition from
learners to engineers who can make tangible contributions to their communities.

Our ultimate goal is to help members build a portfolio of case studies that
demonstrates their ability to create value and solve problems. This portfolio
becomes a testament to their impact—one that opens doors and fosters meaningful
conversations as they pursue careers beyond ÉTS. At CEDILLE, we strive to
empower students to innovate, collaborate, and leave a lasting mark on the
community they belong to.
